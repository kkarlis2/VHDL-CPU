In the second task you will construct some of the individual pieces from which
will consist of the CPU that we will compose in the next task. This CPU has too much
many elements in common with the one described in the book "Organization and Planning
Computers", but it also has differences, with the most important difference being that we are talking about 16bit
architecture and not 32bit.
The pieces you are asked to implement are the following:
➢ Register (reg)
➢ Pseudo register 0 (reg0)
➢ 8 to 1 multiplexer (mux8to1)
➢ Decoder 3 to 8 (decoder3to8)
➢ Register File (reg_file)
➢ Immediate extension (sign_extender)
➢ Calculating JumpAddress (jump_add)
➢ ALU Control (ALU_control)
➢ ALU(ALU)
